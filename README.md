Lazyssh is a terminal-based, interactive SSH manager inspired by tools like lazydocker and k9s — but built for managing your fleet of servers directly from your terminal.
<br/>
With lazyssh, you can quickly navigate, connect, manage, and transfer files between your local machine and any server defined in your `~/.ssh/config`. No more remembering IP addresses or running long scp commands — just a clean, keyboard-driven UI.

## ✨ Features

### Server Management
- 📜 Read & display servers from your `~/.ssh/config` in a scrollable list.
- ➕ Add a new server from the UI with comprehensive SSH configuration options.
- ✏ Edit existing server entries directly from the UI with a tabbed interface.
- 🗑 Delete server entries safely.
- 📌 Pin / unpin servers to keep favorites at the top.
- 🏓 Ping server to check status.

### Quick Server Navigation
- 🔍 Fuzzy search by alias, IP, or tags.
- 🖥 One‑keypress SSH into the selected server (Enter).
- 📋 Copy SSH command to clipboard & paste SSH commands from clipboard to quickly add servers.
- 🏷 Tag servers (e.g., prod, dev, test) for quick filtering.
- ↕️ Sort by alias or last SSH (toggle + reverse).

### Advanced SSH Configuration
- 🔗 Port forwarding (LocalForward, RemoteForward, DynamicForward).
- 🚀 Connection multiplexing for faster subsequent connections.
- 🔐 Advanced authentication options (public key, password, agent forwarding).
- 🔒 Security settings (ciphers, MACs, key exchange algorithms).
- 🌐 Proxy settings (ProxyJump, ProxyCommand).
- ⚙️ Extensive SSH config options organized in tabbed interface.

### Key Management
- 🔑 SSH key autocomplete with automatic detection of available keys.
- 📝 Smart key selection with support for multiple keys.


### Upcoming
- 📁 Copy files between local and servers with an easy picker UI.
- 🔑 SSH Key Deployment Features:
    - Use default local public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)
    - Paste custom public keys manually
    - Generate new keypairs and deploy them
    - Automatically append keys to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with correct permissions

## 🔐 Security Notice

lazyssh does not introduce any new security risks.
It is simply a UI/TUI wrapper around your existing `~/.ssh/config` file.

- All SSH connections are executed through your system’s native ssh binary (OpenSSH).

- Private keys, passwords, and credentials are never stored, transmitted, or modified by lazyssh.

- Your existing IdentityFile paths and ssh-agent integrations work exactly as before.

- lazyssh only reads and updates your `~/.ssh/config`. A backup of the file is created automatically before any changes.

- File permissions on your SSH config are preserved to ensure security.


## 🛡️ Config Safety: Non‑destructive writes and backups

- Non‑destructive edits: lazyssh only writes the minimal required changes to your ~/.ssh/config. It uses a parser that preserves existing comments, spacing, order, and any settings it didn’t touch. Your handcrafted comments and formatting remain intact.
- Atomic writes: updates are written to a temporary file and then atomically renamed over the original, minimizing the risk of partial writes.
- Backups:
  - One‑time original backup: before lazyssh makes its first change, it creates a single snapshot named config.original.backup beside your SSH config. If this file is present, it will never be recreated or overwritten.
  - Rolling backups: on every subsequent save, lazyssh also creates a timestamped backup named like: ~/.ssh/config-<timestamp>-lazyssh.backup. The app keeps at most 10 of these backups, automatically removing the oldest ones.

- chore: maintenance tasks, dependency bumps, non-code infra
- revert: reverts a previous commit

Examples:
- feat(ui): add server pinning and sorting options
- fix(parser): handle comments at end of Host blocks
- improve(cli): show friendly error when ssh binary missing
- refactor(config): simplify backup rotation logic
- docs: add installation instructions for Homebrew
